## Overview
The Steiner Tree Problem is a combinatorial optimization challenge in graph theory, aimed at finding a minimum-cost tree connecting a subset of vertices (terminals) in a graph. This project explores both exact and heuristic approaches to solve the problem, highlighting their trade-offs in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The solution has significant applications in **VLSI design**, **telecommunications**, **transportation networks**, and other fields requiring cost-efficient connectivity.

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. **Branch-and-Bound Algorithm**
- Guarantees an exact solution by systematically exploring all possible trees.
- Uses bounds to prune suboptimal solutions, improving efficiency.
- **Complexity**:  
  - Time: \(O(2^n)\) in the worst case.  
  - Space: \(O(n)\).

### 2. **Vazirani and Yannakakis Algorithm**
- Approximation algorithm with a guaranteed error bound (approximation ratio â‰¤ 2).
- Constructs a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for clusters of terminal nodes and connects them.
- **Complexity**:  
  - Time: \(O(|E| \log(|V|))\), where \(|E|\) is the number of edges and \(|V|\) is the number of vertices.  
  - Space: \(O(n)\).

## Results
- **Branch-and-Bound Algorithm**: Achieved optimal solutions but required significantly more computational time, particularly for larger graphs.
- **Approximation Algorithm**: Delivered near-optimal solutions over 200 times faster than the exact method, making it ideal for real-world applications.
